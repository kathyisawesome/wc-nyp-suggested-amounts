### Known issues

You can technically introduce a suggested amount that is lower than the minimum price. Currently, the onus is on the user to avoid setting up a situation like this.

### Automatic plugin updates

Plugin updates can be enabled by installing the [Git Updater](https://git-updater.com/) plugin.
